#Leap Motion Test App
####Understanding the Leap Motion

An application designed to help new users understand some of the different functions and variables associated with the Leap Motion addon for Openframeworks.

To aid with understanding of what each variable and function call is referring to, visualization aids were added so the user could see the program registering things such as:
Left/ Right hand differentiation (arrows on the palm color coded)
upward facing, downward facing (arrows at palms point in the direction the palm is facing )
direction and velocity of movement (arrows point in direction and become bigger with velocity increases)
distinctly marked joints (color coded for each joint "type" i.e. mcp, pip, dip, tip)
